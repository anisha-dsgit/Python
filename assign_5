1. empty dictionary - {}
2. key:'foo', value=42 , dict ={'foo':42} , so value = 42
3. significant distinction between dict and list : key and value pair, otherwise dictionary and list are iterable, can be modified. 
4. spam['foo'] if spam is {'bar': 100} , it will give an error because there is no key named foo.
5. spam is a dictionary, contains expression 'cat', difference in 'cat' in spam.keys() and 'cat' in dictionary: 
   spam.keys() returns keys of the dictionary
   'cat' as an expression can be the value of the key defined in the dictionary. example: spam={'cat': cat}
6. spam.values() returns values so cat is the value , cat as an expression also is the value. So no difference. 
7. shortcut for the below code: 
   if 'color'not in spam:
   spam['color'] = 'black'; 
here we want to define a new key value pair to the existing dictionary called spam. so, we just write the new key value pair and it will get updated in the dictionary.
 
 example: spam ={}
 spam['color'] = 'black'
 
 output: 
 spam={'color': 'black'}


8. pretty print is a process to see the output in a nice properly indented manner. pprint module is built-in and so imported in python. pprint() function used to pretty print any dictionary. 
example: import pprint
dict ={'bob':[1,2,3,4,5], 'tina': (5,6,6,9)}
pprint.pprint(dict)
